## Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Submit before major releases
- ✅ Keep submission records
- ✅ Be patient (can take days/weeks)
- ✅ Submit each major version
- ✅ Include source code link
- ✅ Be professional and polite
- ✅ Follow up if no response after 2 weeks

### DON'T:
- ❌ Submit daily builds
- ❌ Submit multiple times for same version
- ❌ Use aggressive language
- ❌ Submit malware-like builds (with eval, obfuscation)
- ❌ Give up after first rejection

## Building Reputation

1. **Consistency**: Use same file names, company name
2. **Transparency**: Open source helps tremendously
3. **Community**: Get users to report false positives
4. **Time**: Reputation builds over months/years
5. **Downloads**: More downloads = better reputation

## SmartScreen (Windows)

For Windows SmartScreen:
1. Need EV certificate (expensive) OR
2. Build reputation over time through:
   - Consistent naming
   - Many downloads
   - No malicious reports
   - Time (3-6 months typical)

## Monitoring

After submission:
1. Test new builds with VirusTotal
2. Monitor user reports
3. Keep submission spreadsheet
4. Re-submit if detection returns

## Success Metrics

Track your progress:
- [ ] Microsoft Defender: Submitted ___
- [ ] Norton: Submitted ___
- [ ] McAfee: Submitted ___
- [ ] Avast: Submitted ___
- [ ] Kaspersky: Submitted ___
- [ ] VirusTotal Score: ___/70 clean

Goal: <5 detections on VirusTotal

## Alternative Approaches

If rejections persist:
1. **GitHub Releases**: Users trust GitHub
2. **Web App**: Offer web version
3. **Microsoft Store**: Consider store distribution
4. **User Guide**: Teach users to add exceptions
5. **Checksum**: Provide file hashes

Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Building trust takes time but is worth it for your users!
